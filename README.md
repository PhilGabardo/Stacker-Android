Stacker-Android

A challenging arcade game which entails stacking moving blocks up the screen. As levels increase, the blocks move faster. If you fail to stack up the screen, you lose one of the three lives you begin with! There are power ups which can help you along the way:

- Heart: extra 3 lives
- Turtle: reduced block speed
- Coins: 50 extra points
